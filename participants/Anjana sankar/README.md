ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Currently Learning

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring the intersection of computer science, data, AI, and human-centered design. Iâ€™m especially interested in multidisciplinary research that brings meaningful, actionable insightsâ€”and makes the world just a *little* better.

ðŸŽ¯ Goals for This Year

-  Build my personal design portfolio & find my niche
-  Work on cool, collaborative tech projects
-  Upscale at least one project into a real startup
-  Publish a research paper
-  Make a real impact in the communities I care aboutâ€”especially Women in Tech (WIT)

ðŸ‘¯ How I Want to Collaborate

Open source, climate tech, women in tech, design with empathy, community building, research-driven ideasâ€”Iâ€™m in.  
If youâ€™re building things with purpose (and maybe a little chaos), Iâ€™d *loveeee* to connect.
