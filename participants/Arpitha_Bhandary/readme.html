> Welcome to the magical folder of Arpitha, where my  ideas come to life (after lots of coffee).

##  College Info
 Adi Shankara Institute of Engineering and Technology
- **Branch:** Experimenting in Artificial Intelligence (okay fine, it's Computer Science with AI)
- **Year:** 3rd year a.k.a. “I know enough to break stuff, but not enough to fix it fast”

---

##  Currently Learning
- Turning coffee into clean-ish code ☕
- Designing websites that move, groove, and don’t break (most of the time)
- Graphic design (where colors cry if I use them wrong)
- Machine learning (training computers to be smarter than my brother)

---

##  Goals for This Year
- Build a portfolio that doesn't crash when you click it 🚀
- Join hackathons and try to not panic (too much)
- Write at least one technical blog or tutorial.(hopefullly)
- Publish a personal project that helps other students or developers.

---

##  Collab Mode
  - Designing stuff that looks cool
  - Building things that kinda work
  - Brainstorming with chaotic energy and late-night snacks

---

##  3 Wishes This Month
1. Finish my portfolio before the semester finishes me
2. Learn Flask or Node.js (so I can pretend I’m backend-savvy)
3. Make a GitHub PR that actually gets merged without 42 code review comments

---

##  Fun Fact
I joined a hackathon just for the snacks - ended up winning the Third  place.
